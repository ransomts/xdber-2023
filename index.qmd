# abstract

Programmers and programming students often find support and community through online spaces. Reddit in particular has a large number of active users participating in online communities of practice for programming and learning to program. Topics being discussed in these two spaces provide a rich data source to address the research question: How can we identify topics of discussion for learning through online communities?

In this work I showcase an established natural language topic modeling algorithm (latent drilect allocation, LDA) to compare the topics of discussion between a community of practice and another community intended for learning that practice. Cross community comparisons and intra community historical trends both contribute to an understanding of what practitioners consider important for learning the practice, learners ponts of struggle, and data indicating evolutions of the practice over time.

I investigate the communities r/Python and r/learnpython for this work. Both are highly active (approx. 1.1 million and 648 thousand members respectively) spaces focused on the practice and learning of the Python programming language. This language is quickly becoming the most popular tool of choice for introductory computing courses and so warrants educational analysis from as many data sources as possible.

This methodology of community comparison is easily extended into other domains with online communities. For example on Reddit there are dual communites for math (r/math & r/learnmath), engineering (r/engineering & r/EngineeringStudents), physics (r/Physics & r/learnPhysics), and several other STEM disciplines.

## Natural Language Processing Topic Modeling

Documents are comprised of a mixture of terms and topics.

With sufficiently many documents we can correlate the relationship between terms and topics.

## Uses of NLP in classrooms

 - determine which topics students are asking for help online
   - (assumption) highly requested help topics indicate difficulty in learning
 - determine which topics students can find answers for online
   - (assumption) students are searching for help on Reddit
 - determine which topics students might be most exposed to online

## Latent Drilicht Allocation

LDA [@blei2003latent] is a well established 

 Applying Topic Modling to Reddit

## Illuminatory Example

## What is Reddit

![Reddit](figures/Reddit_Mark_OnWhite.svg){width=10%}

BBS-system pseudo-anonymous social media

Organized into subreddits around topics

## Conceptualizing subreddits as communities of practice

 - people :: subscribed users
 - practice :: topic of the subreddit
 - culture :: internet jargon


## Subreddit CoP Topic Overlap

```{r}
library(ggvenn)
library(svglite)

data <- list(`r/python` = c("code", "python", "function"),
          `r/learnpython` = c("help", "how to", "want", "python"))
venn <- ggvenn(data, c("r/python", "r/learnpython"), show_elements = TRUE, label_sep = "\n\n", fill_color = c("#F56600", "#522D80"))

ggsave(filename = "figures/subreddit_venn.svg", plot = venn)
